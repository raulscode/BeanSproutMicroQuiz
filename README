<!--BeanSprout MicroQuiz-->

--Introduction--

This project is a full stack web app that can display and generate quizzes and flash cards according to user input (which are all saved in a database). It is inspired by my experiences with various flash card systems, which helped me learn and memorize more easily, with discrete and digestable content.

On a technical level, one of my aims with this project was to learn more about Spring Boot, while also trying out a few different methods for managing entities directly and indirectly with a SQL server.

As far as the title of the project goes, it is tentative. While diving heavily into SpringBoot for the first time and getting used to all the bean terminology, I suddenly couldn't stop thinking about beans. I subconsciously started eating more beans. I even planted a small garbanzo garden on our balcony. Naturally, I decided to call this project BeanSprout, as it evokes the metaphor of growing your knowledge with one small seedling at a time.

--Overview--
This project is a Spring Boot project that used the Spring Initializr, with necessary dependencies added at that time.

It has two primary entities that interact with the user: a Quiz entity and a FlashCard entity. These entities have a relationship, where a Quiz is essentially just a collection of flash card questions.

All flash cards are multiple choice. They have 1 question (the "front"), stores as a String, and a list of multiple-choice possible answers, stores as an ArrayList of Strings. They also have a parameter called "answer", which is an integer that indicates which of the answers is the correct one. Each card also has an id which does not change.

Quizzes have an id, a title, and an ArrayList of FlashCard entities, which is used to manage their relationship to the flash cards.

Using the app, the user can:

	- View a list of all quizzes
	- View a list of all flash cards
	- View quiz contents and take the quiz
	- View individual flash card questions
	- Generate a new quiz
	- Generate flash cards for that quiz
	- Edit flash cards
	- Edit quiz titles
	- Delete quizzes (without deleting corresponding flash cards)
	- Delete individual flash cards

All of this is saved in a MySql database, mostly managed through entities in Spring Boot, though there are some manually-written custom queries (such as the one to simply change a quiz title).
